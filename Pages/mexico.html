        Chichén Itzá, ruined ancient Maya city occupying an area of 4 square miles (10 square km) in south-central Yucatán state, Mexico.
         It is thought to have been a religious, military, political, and commercial center 
         that at its peak would have been home to 35,000 people.

         Chichen Itza was founded by the Maya, an ancient people inhabiting the Yucatan peninsula. Within the Yucatan Peninsula
        , Mayan culture and architectural style varied from area to area, with several groups establishing themselves across the region.
        At its height, Chichen Itza was home to Mayan people from all areas of the Yucatan Peninsula. The city 
        exhibits many architectural styles, reminiscent of styles seen in central Mexico and of the Puuc and Chenes
         styles found in the Northern Maya lowlands.Historians believe that Chichen Itza was founded and rose
        to prominence due to its proximity to the Xtoloc cenote, an underground source of fresh water.

        When the sun is at its highest point, you’ll get a glimpse of a magnificent view: 
        the tail of the snake grows — its shadow — and is 
        projected by the sun, due to the tilt of the surrounding buildings in Chichen Itza.

        The phenomenon can be seen during the equinoxes of March and September when the sun hits the nine bases. 
        This amazing sight shows the Mayans’ inclination toward mathematics, astronomy, and the sciences, and how it mixed with their culture.
